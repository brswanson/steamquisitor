### Steamquisitor
Just a simple SPA using React with a NodeJS backend. I wanted to learn a little more about Steam's APIs and get some practice in.

Hosted on [Heroku](https://steamquisitor.herokuapp.com).

***Note***: It defaults to my Steam ID since there isn't currently any way to search for your ID in the app and Steam makes it somewhat difficult to figure out what your ID is anyway. You can use your own ID if you know it.
